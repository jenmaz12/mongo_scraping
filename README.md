# New York Times Scraper
This application uses axios and cheerio node packages to scrape the New York Times website, save article titles and links to a Mongo database, and display to the user headlines and links to articles. When the user selects a headline, a modal appears allowing them to add a note to the article database entry. This note is saved in the database, so it shows in the note fields when the user clicks on the headline again.
